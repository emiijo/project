                    <h3>HyperText Markup Language</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>.</p>
                        <li>HyperText Markup Language was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s to describe web
                            pages.</li>
                        <li>We use HTML to label and accommodate content on web pages.</li>
                        <li>And the first document while making a web page (HTML) for coding is always called
                            "index.html".</li>
                        <li>Let's go through the basic form and syntax for elements, attributes and entities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                    <h3>Elements and building a HTML document:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In order to build a HTML document, it requires assembling a sequence of elements.</li>
                        <li>In HTML, the characters surrounded by angle brackets are called "tags".</li>
                        <li>Tags and the content between (and inside) elements are also called elements.</li>
                        <li>Elements may contain name/value pairs, called attributes. If an element has attributes, they
                            always go in the the start-tag.</li>
                        <li>Elements are generally organized in a hierarchal way; with elements nested within elements).
                        </li>
                        <li>Elements that don't have content, does not need to have an ending tag:</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article><b>Example:</b>
                    <br><img src="selfclosing elements.jpg" />
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p>How the general HTML document should be set up:</p>
                    <img width="100" src="htmldokument.png">

                    <p>After that, you simply add the desired containers to build up the web site as you want it to be
                        presented.
                        If you want a logo, main content, aside content. A footer, header, signature etc.
                        As well as choose colors and shadows. The options are limitless.
                    </p>

                    <p>Once you have your layout in codes of the website, you may add your content. As in text, pictures
                        etc.
                        Before you move on to the styling part, which means: <a style=color:cadetblue; href="css.html">CSS</a>. </p>
